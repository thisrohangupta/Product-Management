# YAML Gallery

This is a minimal Next.js application written in TypeScript that scans the repository for YAML files and displays them in a gallery. Clicking on a file opens a dialog with its contents.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the gallery.

The UI follows shadcn styling conventions using Tailwind CSS. Some tooling commands such as `shadcn-ui init` may require network access.
